            Summarize the key information related to Team, Business Model, and Traction from the slide. 
            Consider the following questions for each slide, and use the examples below to guide your assessment:

            **Team Evaluation:**
            1. **Does the founding team appear to be complete?** 
                - Look for whether the team is a single founder or a group. If the team consists of only one founder, it may be seen as a **red flag** unless they have strong experience or advisors. Teams with multiple founders or a well-rounded advisory board are often seen as more robust. 
                - Example: "The team lacks co-founders, which may hinder collaboration and strategic decision-making."

            2. **Does the team have the strength and qualifications to compete in this particular industry or market?**
                - Evaluate whether the team‚Äôs **background and skills** align with the industry. A strong team should have relevant experience and expertise.
                - Example: "The founder has some experience in the tech space but lacks expertise in the fashion industry."

            3. **Does the founding team have relevant industry experience?**
                - The more **direct experience** the team has in the industry, the higher the evaluation. If their experience is more **general** or from a **different industry**, their chances of success might be lower.
                - Example: "The team has industry-relevant experience and the founder has built a successful startup before."

            4. **Have the founders previously worked together?**
                - Teams that have worked together in the past tend to perform better, especially if they‚Äôve succeeded together before. Lack of prior collaboration might be a **concern**.
                - Example: "The founder is working solo, which could be a **challenge** in building a strong, collaborative team."

            **Business Model Evaluation:**
            1. **Is the business model scalable?**
                - Evaluate if the business can grow quickly without **substantial increases in costs**. Scalable models like **SaaS** or **digital-first businesses** tend to score higher, while **hardware or capital-intensive models** score lower.
                - Example: "The business model is a digital marketplace, which is scalable."

            2. **Does the business have the potential to add new product lines, services, or upsell to existing customers?**
                - A **scalable business model** that allows for product/service **expansion** and **upselling** is more likely to succeed. Look for opportunities for **growth** beyond the initial offering.
                - Example: "The business has the potential to diversify its product line and cross-sell additional services."

            3. **Is the business model resilient to external shocks?**
                - Consider whether the business is **immune** to risks like **regulatory changes** or **geopolitical factors**. Resilient business models like **software-only** businesses or those not reliant on global supply chains are less vulnerable.
                - Example: "The business model is highly vulnerable to changes in international shipping regulations."

            4. **Does the business create a new market or unlock a 'shadow market'?**
                - If the business is **innovative** and disrupts an existing market or creates a **new category**, it‚Äôs more likely to succeed. If it‚Äôs entering an already saturated market, it may face **more competition**.
                - Example: "The business targets a niche market in sustainable fashion, which is currently underserved."

            **Traction Evaluation:**
            1. **Does the business have initial customers or users?**
                - Businesses with **early customers** are generally more likely to succeed. Look for **proof of market fit** (e.g., paying customers, partnerships).
                - Example: "The business has initial customers, and it‚Äôs clear that there is demand for the product."

            2. **Is the business demonstrating rapid growth?**
                - Rapid growth is a strong indicator that the business is **scaling successfully**. Look for metrics like **user growth**, **revenue growth**, and **expansion into new markets**.
                - Example: "The company is growing steadily, but the growth rate is not impressive yet."

            3. **Is there an indication of good customer retention?**
                - High retention rates or repeat customers indicate that the product or service is **meeting customer needs**. If retention is low, the business might face **sustainability issues**.
                - Example: "Customer retention rates are low, which could indicate dissatisfaction with the product."

            4. **What metrics or KPIs can demonstrate the business‚Äôs growth trajectory?**
                - Look for **growth metrics** such as **revenue growth**, **user acquisition rates**, or **increased market share**.
                - Example: "The business has shown strong growth in its customer base, increasing GMV by 30% month-over-month."

        Use the criteria below to guide your evaluations:

        **Team Evaluation:**
        1. **Does the founding team appear to be complete?** 
           - Score **1** if the team consists of multiple co-founders with complementary skill sets and/or has a strong **advisory board**. This is crucial for well-rounded decision-making and execution.
           - Score **0.5** if the team has some experience but is missing key members or lacks a strong advisory board.
           - Score **0** if the team has a single founder with limited expertise or no strong advisor network.
        
        2. **Does the team have the strength and qualifications to compete in this industry or market?**
           - Score **1** if the team has deep industry experience or has successfully built similar companies before. Strong founders should have **domain expertise** and know the challenges of the market.
           - Score **0.5** if the team has some relevant experience but lacks extensive or direct industry knowledge.
           - Score **0** if the team has minimal experience or lacks knowledge in the market they are targeting.
        
        3. **Does the founding team have relevant industry experience?**
           - Score **1** if the team has **direct experience** in the relevant industry, with clear examples of successful prior ventures or expertise.
           - Score **0.5** if the experience is somewhat relevant but not directly applicable.
           - Score **0** if the team lacks relevant industry experience and it is clear that they will need significant learning to succeed in the market.
        
        4. **Have the founders previously worked together?**
           - Score **1** if the founders have worked together in the past, particularly if they have **succeeded** in building a previous startup or project.
           - Score **0.5** if they have limited or **unproven collaboration history**.
           - Score **0** if the founders have **never worked together** or have little evidence of working cohesively as a team.
        
        **Business Model Evaluation:**
        1. **Is the business model scalable?**
           - Score **1** if the business model is **highly scalable**, such as a **B2B SaaS** model, which can grow without significantly increasing costs.
           - Score **0.5** if the business model has scalability potential but faces inherent limitations, such as high capital expenditure or operational complexity.
           - Score **0** if the business model is **difficult to scale**, such as a highly **capex-intensive** hardware business.
        
        2. **Does the business have the potential to add new product lines, services, or upsell to existing customers?**
           - Score **1** if the business has **clear potential for growth** by adding new products, expanding services, or creating upsell opportunities for existing customers (e.g., **cross-selling** or **expanding market reach**).
           - Score **0.5** if there‚Äôs some opportunity for upselling or adding products, but it‚Äôs not fully explored or there are challenges in expanding the offering.
           - Score **0** if the business lacks the ability to diversify or expand its product line and seems confined to a single offering.
        
        3. **Is the business model resilient to external shocks?**
           - Score **1** if the business model is **resilient** to external risks like **economic downturns**, **regulatory changes**, or **geopolitical instability**. Businesses that are **software-only** or have strong IP protection are generally more resilient.
           - Score **0.5** if the business has some degree of vulnerability to external factors but has mitigating strategies.
           - Score **0** if the business is **highly vulnerable** to external risks, such as reliance on global supply chains or markets prone to sudden regulation changes.
        
        4. **Does the business create a new market or unlock a 'shadow market'?**
           - Score **1** if the business model creates a **new market** or significantly **disrupts an existing market**, unlocking new opportunities (e.g., **disruptive innovation** or **addressing an unmet need**).
           - Score **0.5** if the business model operates in an **existing market** but may have some level of differentiation or market opportunity.
           - Score **0** if the business is operating in an **over-saturated market** or has little to no differentiation from existing competitors.
        
        **Traction Evaluation:**
        1. **Does the business have initial customers or users?**
           - Score **1** if the business has **early customers** or users, especially paying customers, or has clear evidence of **product-market fit**.
           - Score **0.5** if the business has some customers, but it‚Äôs unclear whether they are early adopters or if the product is truly resonating with the market.
           - Score **0** if the business has **no initial customers** or users, indicating a lack of product-market fit.
        
        2. **Is the business demonstrating rapid growth?**
           - Score **1** if the business is showing **rapid growth** in key metrics such as **revenue**, **users**, or **market share**.
           - Score **0.5** if the business is growing steadily but not at an **accelerated rate**.
           - Score **0** if the business is **not growing quickly** and there‚Äôs limited indication of significant expansion.
        
        3. **Is there an indication of good customer retention?**
           - Score **1** if the business has **high customer retention rates**, repeat customers, or **strong lifetime value (LTV)**.
           - Score **0.5** if retention data is mixed or unclear but the business shows potential to retain customers with future iterations.
           - Score **0** if retention is **low** or unclear, or if the business has no evidence of **customer loyalty**.
        
        4. **What metrics or KPIs can demonstrate the business‚Äôs growth trajectory?**
