Summarize the key information related to Team, Business Model, and Traction from the slide. 
Consider the following questions for each slide, and use the examples below to guide your assessment:

**Team Evaluation:**
1. **Does the founding team appear to be complete?** 
    - Look for whether the team is a single founder or a group. If the team consists of only one founder, it may be seen as a **red flag** unless they have strong experience or advisors. Teams with multiple founders or a well-rounded advisory board are often seen as more robust. 
    - Example: "The team lacks co-founders, which may hinder collaboration and strategic decision-making."

2. **Does the team have the strength and qualifications to compete in this particular industry or market?**
    - Evaluate whether the team’s **background and skills** align with the industry. A strong team should have relevant experience and expertise.
    - Example: "The founder has some experience in the tech space but lacks expertise in the fashion industry."

3. **Does the founding team have relevant industry experience?**
    - The more **direct experience** the team has in the industry, the higher the evaluation. If their experience is more **general** or from a **different industry**, their chances of success might be lower.
    - Example: "The team has industry-relevant experience and the founder has built a successful startup before."

4. **Have the founders previously worked together?**
    - Teams that have worked together in the past tend to perform better, especially if they’ve succeeded together before. Lack of prior collaboration might be a **concern**.
    - Example: "The founder is working solo, which could be a **challenge** in building a strong, collaborative team."

**Business Model Evaluation:**
1. **Is the business model scalable?**
    - Evaluate if the business can grow quickly without **substantial increases in costs**. Scalable models like **SaaS** or **digital-first businesses** tend to score higher, while **hardware or capital-intensive models** score lower.
    - Example: "The business model is a digital marketplace, which is scalable."

2. **Does the business have the potential to add new product lines, services, or upsell to existing customers?**
    - A **scalable business model** that allows for product/service **expansion** and **upselling** is more likely to succeed. Look for opportunities for **growth** beyond the initial offering.
    - Example: "The business has the potential to diversify its product line and cross-sell additional services."

3. **Is the business model resilient to external shocks?**
    - Consider whether the business is **immune** to risks like **regulatory changes** or **geopolitical factors**. Resilient business models like **software-only** businesses or those not reliant on global supply chains are less vulnerable.
    - Example: "The business model is highly vulnerable to changes in international shipping regulations."

4. **Does the business create a new market or unlock a 'shadow market'?**
    - If the business is **innovative** and disrupts an existing market or creates a **new category**, it’s more likely to succeed. If it’s entering an already saturated market, it may face **more competition**.
    - Example: "The business targets a niche market in sustainable fashion, which is currently underserved."

**Traction Evaluation:**
1. **Does the business have initial customers or users?**
    - Businesses with **early customers** are generally more likely to succeed. Look for **proof of market fit** (e.g., paying customers, partnerships).
    - Example: "The business has initial customers, and it’s clear that there is demand for the product."

2. **Is the business demonstrating rapid growth?**
    - Rapid growth is a strong indicator that the business is **scaling successfully**. Look for metrics like **user growth**, **revenue growth**, and **expansion into new markets** and compare it with the standards for this type of business.
    - Example: "The company is growing steadily, but the growth rate is not impressive yet."

3. **Is there an indication of good customer retention?**
    - High retention rates or repeat customers indicate that the product or service is **meeting customer needs**. If retention is low, the business might face **sustainability issues**. Compare it with the standards for this type of business.
    - Example: "Customer retention rates are low, which could indicate dissatisfaction with the product."

4. **What metrics or KPIs can demonstrate the business’s growth trajectory?**
    - Look for **growth metrics** such as **revenue growth**, **user acquisition rates**, or **increased market share**.
    - Example: "The business has shown strong growth in its customer base, increasing GMV by 30% month-over-month."
