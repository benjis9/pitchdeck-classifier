Provide a **straight-talking, factual, and objective evaluation**. Avoid speculation and emotional language. Assess the business with realistic expectations, based on evidence from the deck. Use the criteria below to guide your evaluations:

**Team Evaluation:**
1. **Does the founding team appear to be complete?** 
   - Score **1** if the team consists of multiple co-founders with complementary skill sets and/or has a strong **advisory board**. This is crucial for well-rounded decision-making and execution.
   - Score **0.5** if the team has some experience but is missing key members or lacks a strong advisory board.
   - Score **0** if the team has a single founder with limited expertise or no strong advisor network.

2. **Does the team have the strength and qualifications to compete in this industry or market?**
   - Score **1** if the team has deep industry experience or has successfully built similar companies before. Strong founders should have **domain expertise** and know the challenges of the market.
   - Score **0.5** if the team has some relevant experience but lacks extensive or direct industry knowledge.
   - Score **0** if the team has minimal experience or lacks knowledge in the market they are targeting.

3. **Does the founding team have relevant industry experience?**
   - Score **1** if the team has **direct experience** in the relevant industry, with clear examples of successful prior ventures or expertise.
   - Score **0.5** if the experience is somewhat relevant but not directly applicable.
   - Score **0** if the team lacks relevant industry experience and it is clear that they will need significant learning to succeed in the market.

4. **Have the founders previously worked together?**
   - Score **1** if the founders have worked together in the past, particularly if they have **succeeded** in building a previous startup or project.
   - Score **0.5** if they have limited or **unproven collaboration history**.
   - Score **0** if the founders have **never worked together** or have little evidence of working cohesively as a team.

**Business Model Evaluation:**
1. **Is the business model scalable?**
   - Score **1** if the business model is **highly scalable**, such as a **B2B SaaS** model, which can grow without significantly increasing costs.
   - Score **0.5** if the business model has scalability potential but faces inherent limitations, such as high capital expenditure or operational complexity.
   - Score **0** if the business model is **difficult to scale**, such as a highly **capex-intensive** hardware business.

2. **Does the business have the potential to add new product lines, services, or upsell to existing customers?**
   - Score **1** if the business has **clear potential for growth** by adding new products, expanding services, or creating upsell opportunities for existing customers (e.g., **cross-selling** or **expanding market reach**).
   - Score **0.5** if there’s some opportunity for upselling or adding products, but it’s not fully explored or there are challenges in expanding the offering.
   - Score **0** if the business lacks the ability to diversify or expand its product line and seems confined to a single offering.

3. **Is the business model resilient to external shocks?**
   - Score **1** if the business model is **resilient** to external risks like **economic downturns**, **regulatory changes**, or **geopolitical instability**. Businesses that are **software-only** or have strong IP protection are generally more resilient.
   - Score **0.5** if the business has some degree of vulnerability to external factors but has mitigating strategies.
   - Score **0** if the business is **highly vulnerable** to external risks, such as reliance on global supply chains or markets prone to sudden regulation changes.

4. **Does the business create a new market or unlock a 'shadow market'?**
   - Score **1** if the business model creates a **new market** or significantly **disrupts an existing market**, unlocking new opportunities (e.g., **disruptive innovation** or **addressing an unmet need**).
   - Score **0.5** if the business model operates in an **existing market** but may have some level of differentiation or market opportunity.
   - Score **0** if the business is operating in an **over-saturated market** or has little to no differentiation from existing competitors.

**Traction Evaluation:**
1. **Does the business have initial customers or users?**
   - Score **1** if the business has **early customers** or users, especially paying customers, or has clear evidence of **product-market fit**.
   - Score **0.5** if the business has some customers, but it’s unclear whether they are early adopters or if the product is truly resonating with the market.
   - Score **0** if the business has **no initial customers** or users, indicating a lack of product-market fit.

2. **Is the business demonstrating rapid growth?**
   - Score **1** if the business is showing **rapid growth** in key metrics such as **revenue**, **users**, or **market share**.
   - Score **0.5** if the business is growing steadily but not at an **accelerated rate**.
   - Score **0** if the business is **not growing quickly** and there’s limited indication of significant expansion.

3. **Is there an indication of good customer retention?**
   - Score **1** if the business has **high customer retention rates**, repeat customers, or **strong lifetime value (LTV)**.
   - Score **0.5** if retention data is mixed or unclear but the business shows potential to retain customers with future iterations.
   - Score **0** if retention is **low** or unclear, or if the business has no evidence of **customer loyalty**.

4. **What metrics or KPIs can demonstrate the business’s growth trajectory?**
   - Score **1** if the business shows clear **metrics** of success, such as **revenue growth**, **customer acquisition rates**, **GMV**, or **user engagement**.
   - Score **0.5** if there are **some metrics** available, but they are insufficient to demonstrate long-term growth.
   - Score **0** if there are **no key metrics** or KPIs available to demonstrate growth.
